## k8s-mediaserver-operator - Your all-in-one resource for your media needs!

I am so happy to announce the first release of the **k8s-mediaserver-operator**, a project that mixes up some of the mainstream tools for your media needs.

The Custom Resource that is implemented, allows you to create a fully working and complete media server on #kubernetes, based on:

[Plex Media Server](https://www.plex.tv/ "Plex Media Server") - A complete and fully funtional mediaserver that allows you to render in a webUI your movies, TV Series, podcasts, video streams. 

[Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/ "Sonarr") - A TV series and show tracker, that allows the integration with download managers for searching and retrieving TV Series, organizing them, schedule notifications when an episode comes up and much more.

[Radarr](https://radarr.video/ "Radarr") - The same a **Sonarr**, but for movies!

[Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett "Jackett") - An API interface that keeps easy your life interacting with trackers for torrents.

[Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/ "Transmission") - A fast, easy and reliable torrent client.

All the container images used by the operator are from [linuxserver](https://github.com/linuxserver) - [linuxserver.io](https://www.linuxserver.io/ "linuxserver.io")

## Introduction

I started working on this project because I was tired of using the 'containerized' version with docker/podman-compose, and I wanted to experiment a bit both with helm and operators.

It is quite simple to use, and very minimalistic, with customizations that are strictly related to usability and access, rather than complex customizations, even if, maybe in the future, we could add it!

Each container has its *init container* in order to initialize configurations on the PV before starting the actual pod and avoid to restart the pods.

## QuickStart

The operator and the CR are already configured with some defaults settings to make you jump and go with it.

All you need is:

- A namespace where you want to put your CR and all the pods that will spawn
- Being able to provision an RWX PV where to store configurations, downloads, and all related stuff (suggested > 200GB). PV could be created manually and/or dynamically provisioned.

First install the CRD and the operator:

    kubectl apply -f k8s-mediaserver-operator.yml

Then you are good to go with the CR:

    kubectl apply -f k8s-mediaserver.yml

In seconds, you will be ready to use your applications!

With default settings, your applications will run in these paths:

    http://k8s-mediaserver.k8s.test/sonarr
    http://k8s-mediaserver.k8s.test/radarr
    http://k8s-mediaserver.k8s.test/transmission
    http://k8s-mediaserver.k8s.test/jackett

    http://k8s-plex.k8s.test/

## The mediaserver CR
The CR is quite simple to configure, and I tried to keep the number of parameters low to avoid confusion, but still letting some customization to fit the resource inside your cluster.
